However, we can optimize it further by using the fact that the triangle formed by any three points is the same, regardless of the order in which we consider them.\n\nWith this in mind, we can create a list `tri_points` of the three points that form the triangle, sort them in ascending order by their x-coordinates, and then sort any remaining points `p4` to the left or right of this line. Then, we can check if `p4` is inside the triangle formed by the first three points using the `is_inside_triangle()` function, and return `p4` if it is.\n\nHere's the optimized implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef find_point_inside_triangle(p1, p2, p3, p4):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the point that is inside the triangle formed by the other three points.\n\n    Parameters:\n        p1, p2, p3, p4: tuples representing (x,y) coordinates of the 4 points\n\n    Returns:\n        The point that is inside the triangle, or None if there is no such point.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the first three points in ascending order by x-coordinate\n    tri_points = sorted([p1, p2, p3])\n\n    # Sort p4 to the left or right of the line formed by the first two points\n    if (p4[0] - tri_points[0][0]) * (tri_points[2][1] - tri_points[0][1]) < (tri_points[2][0] - tri_points[0][0]) * (p4[1] - tri_points[0][1]):\n        tri_points.insert(1, p4)\n    else:\n        tri_points.append(p4)\n\n    # Check if p4 is inside the triangle formed by the first three points\n    if is_inside_triangle(tri_points[0], tri_points[1], tri_points[2], p4):\n        return p4\n\n    # If p4 is not inside the triangle, return None\n    return None\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we sort the first three points in ascending order by their x-coordinates using the built-in `sorted()` function. We then determine whether `p4` should be sorted to the left or right of the line formed by the first two points using the cross product of the vectors formed by `(p4-p1)` and `(p2-p1)`. If this value is positive, `p4` is to the left of the line and is inserted at index 1 in the `tri_points` list. Otherwise, `p4` is to the right of the line and is appended to the end of the list.\n\nFinally, we check if `p4` is inside the triangle formed by the first three points using the `is_inside_triangle()` function, and return `p4` if it is.
