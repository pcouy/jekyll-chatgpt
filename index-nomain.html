                <h1>Example ChatGPT conversation</h1>
                <p>The conversations below have been randomly chosen from my experiments trying to break ChatGPT. They may include weird stuff or counterfactual affirmations. A <a href="index.html">demo using the full theme from my personal website is also available</a>.</p>
                <article>
                    <h2>Branching conversation about the date</h2>
                    <p>The conversation below demonstrates the ablility to navigate branching conversations (when you edit your own request, or make ChatGPT re-generate a reply)</p>
                    {{ site.data.chatgpt["date"] | chatgpt }}
                </article>

                    <h2>Markdown formatting including code blocks</h2>
                    <p>This conversation features markdown formatting such as code blocks and the use of backticks (`) to inline variablme or function names. By default, the `chatgpt` filter will render markdown in both user input and assistant output. This uses the jekyll `markdownify` filter. Note that for the last message (when viewing only the first branch of this conversation) seems to cause errors in markdown parsing.</p>
                    {{ site.data.chatgpt["python_triangle"] | chatgpt }}

                    <h2>Disabling markdown rendering</h2>
                    <p>If the content of the conversation contains parts that are wrongly interpreted as markdown by the markdownify filter, you can always disable markdown rendering by passing the `false` argument to the `chatgpt` filter. The text will be rendered as inline pre-formatted text. In the example below, the pipe (|) characters are interpreted as a table when rendering markdown.</p>
                    {{ site.data.chatgpt["delimiter_tokens"] | chatgpt: false }}
